# python-challenge
I got my codes to work for both Pybank and Pypoll but for some reason I wasn't able to create a txt file, I did use chat gpt to confirm my codes were correct, it was correct but yet it still would not create a txt file. I'm not sure if maybe I didn't download one of the files or i'm missing something. Nonethelless I did add both codes for submission
